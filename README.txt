basically it wont have icons because python by default searches in system32 if the code searches for a image
UPDATE:
1.To run it dont click the file just copy the py file to your user's folder and then run: Python.exe APad.py (you need python installed and the modules: PyQt5 you can install them via (pip install (module name here) )
2. enjoy programming or writing in APad!
